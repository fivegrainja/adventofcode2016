# adventofcode2016

IMPORTANT

This code was developed as part of a contest with co-workers at the time. Scoring was based on how quickly we could produce the solutions. As such the code is messy, ugly, without tests, without many comments... in other words it doesn't represent how I normally code. You've been warned :-)
